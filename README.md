# sponsor-search-marketing

In the evolving landscape of e-commerce and digital marketing, online advertising and dynamic pricing are pivotal tools for businesses striving to maximize profits. These tools often present a tradeoff: spending more on online advertisements and sponsored search increases visibility and sales but comes at higher costs, while reducing prices can attract cost-sensitive consumers but diminishes revenue per transaction. Understanding and optimizing this balance is a critical challenge for businesses, especially when faced with strategic consumers who make purchasing decisions based on both price and advertising cues.

This thesis aims to explore this interplay by developing a simulation framework based on the model proposed by Ye et al. (2015) in their seminal work on sponsored search marketing. The model provides an analytical foundation for examining the dynamic relationship between advertising expenditure (via bids for sponsored search) and pricing strategies. By implementing and extending this model, the research seeks to:

Quantify Profit Dynamics: Evaluate how businesses can maximize profits over time by strategically balancing advertisement spending and pricing decisions.
Understand Consumer Behavior: Investigate the impact of strategic consumer behavior on purchase likelihood, influenced by both ad visibility (click probability) and price sensitivity (purchase probability).
Assess Distributional Impacts: Examine the outcomes under varying demand and consumer behavior distributions, enabling insights into how different market conditions affect optimal strategies.
Provide Decision-Making Insights: Offer actionable insights for online retailers on optimal bidding and pricing strategies across multiple time periods.
The simulation employs dynamic programming and optimization techniques to model and solve this complex decision-making problem. By incorporating different probabilistic distributions—such as Weibull, Gamma, and others—it accounts for diverse consumer behavior patterns and demand variability. The outputs, including average inventory levels, profit trends, pricing, and bidding strategies over time, provide a comprehensive view of how businesses can align their pricing and advertising strategies to achieve sustainable profitability.

Through this approach, the thesis not only validates the theoretical underpinnings of Ye et al.’s model but also expands its practical applicability by simulating real-world scenarios and examining the robustness of optimal strategies across different market conditions. This work contributes to the broader understanding of dynamic pricing and advertising interplay, equipping businesses with tools to navigate the complexities of modern e-commerce ecosystems.
